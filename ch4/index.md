# Exercises

1. _Construct the Kleisli category for partial functions (define composition and identity)._
2. _Implement the embellished function safe_reciprocal that returns a valid reciprocal of its argument, if itâ€™s different from zero._
3. _Compose safe_root and safe_reciprocal to implement safe_root_reciprocal that calculates sqrt(1/x) whenever possible._

Implemented in [ch4.cpp](./ch4.cpp)
